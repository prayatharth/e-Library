## Python Tutorial

![Python Tutorial](https://cdn.journaldev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Python-Tutorial.png)

Python is one of the most popular programming languages. In the last few years, it has gained a lot of popularity due to the increasing interest in Data Science, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

----------

Just have a look at the Google Trends chart for interest in Python programming language. It’s increasing continuously and it will keep on increasing over time.

Python Interest Over Time

## Why to learn Python Programming?

1.  Python programming is very simple, elegant, and English like. So it’s very easy to learn and a good programming language to start your IT career.
2.  Python is open source and you are free to extend it and make something beautiful out of it.
3.  Python has vast community support. There are over a million questions on StackOverflow in Python category.
4.  There are tons of free modules and packages to help you in every area of development.
5.  Most of the Machine Learning, Data Science, Graphs, Artificial Intelligence APIs are built on top of Python. So if you want to work in the area of cutting-edge technologies then it’s a great choice for you.
6.  Python is used by almost every major company in the world. So the chances of getting a job are much better if you know Python programming. If you are applying for any Python job, please go through  [Python Interview Questions](https://www.journaldev.com/15490/python-interview-questions).
7.  There are no limitations to Python programming, you can use it in IoT, web applications, game development, cryptography, blockchain, scientific calculations, graphs and many other areas.

## Python Tutorial

Python Tutorial can be broadly divided into the following categories.

1.  Python Basics – syntax, data types, variables, loops, functions, numbers, strings, classes, objects etc.
2.  Python Built-in Functions – format(), len(), super(), range(), slice(), tuple(), list() etc.
3.  Python Modules – collections, json, xml, io, os, sys, time, datetime etc.
4.  Web Applications Frameworks – Django, Flask
5.  Advanced Topics – Graphs, AI, ML modules such as Matplotlib, NumPy, TensorFlow, SciKit, Pandas etc.

## Python Tutorial Important Points

1.  If you are completely new to Python, spend enough time to go through basics. If your basics in Python won’t be strong then your code won’t be pythonic in nature.
2.  Python has two running major versions – Python-2 and Python-3. Python-3 is not backward compatible with Python-2. However, Python 3 is the recommended version to use. That’s why all the Python tutorials here are based on Python 3.
3.  While reading through the Python tutorials, please follow the examples and run them in your IDE for better understanding.
4.  PyCharm from JetBrains is the perfect IDE for Python programming. Its community edition is free to use.
5.  Most of our examples are present in our GitHub Repository. You can download them and look at the examples. I would recommend you to fork the project and then play around with the code.
6.  We have covered extensively on Python if you think we have missed some important topic. Please feel free to comment here and I will include them too.
