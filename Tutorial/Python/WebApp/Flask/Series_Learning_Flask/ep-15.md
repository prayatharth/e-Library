Setting, getting and working with cookies in Flask

Cookies play an important role in most modern websites and web applications, allowing us leave small strings of key/value pairs on the clients browser to help both developers and users by temporarily preserving inportant information such as preferences, unique identifiers, state etc..

Fortunately for us, Flask makes working with cookies very simple.

Let's get started.

### Flask imports

Working with cookies requires a couple of imports from Flask.

-   `request`  To set and get cookies
-   `make_response`  - To build a response to attach cookies to

Go ahead and import them at the top of your Flask app:
```py
from flask import request, make_response
```

### Create a new route

For this example, we're going to create a simple route with the URL  `/cookies`:
```py
@app.route("/cookies")
def cookies():

    resp = make_response("Cookies")

    return resp
```
We've create a response by passing a simple string to the  `make_response`  function  `resp = make_response("Cookies")`  which is then returned.

The exact same thing would be achieved with:
```py
@app.route("/cookies")
def cookies():

    return "Cookies"
```
We're not covering  `make_response`  in detail in this part, just know that you can build your response ahead of time and modify it before returning it!

If you wanted to return a template, you would do the following:
```py
@app.route("/cookies")
def cookies():

    resp = make_response(render_template("cookies.html"))

    return resp 
```
It's exactly the same as:
```py
@app.route("/cookies")
def cookies():

    return render_template("cookies.html") 
```
The difference is that by using  `make_response`  we can build and modify our request ahead of sending it.

### Setting cookies

Setting cookies is a simple affair. We simply attach them to our response object.

The syntax for setting a cookie is:
```py
response.set_cookie("key", "value")
```
For example, let's set a cookie with the key of  `flavor`  and the  `value`  of  `chocolate chip`:
```py
@app.route("/cookies")
def cookies():

    resp = make_response("Cookies")

    resp.set_cookie("flavor", "chocolate chip")

    return resp
```
If you open the developer tools in your browser, head to the  `storage`  tab and select  `cookies`  from the navigation on the left, you'll see that the  `flavour`  cookie has been set!

### Cookie parameters

You might notice in the developer tools, cookies have several parameters including  `key`,  `value`,  `domain`,  `path`  and more, all of which can be set using Flask.

The  `set_cookie`  function takes the following parameters:
```py
set_cookie(
    key, 
    value='', 
    max_age=None, 
    expires=None, 
    path='/', 
    domain=None, 
    secure=False, 
    httponly=False, 
    samesite=None
)
```
See the table below for a breakdown of the cookie parameters available:
|  |  |
|--|--|
|  |  |


|Parameter	|Default|	Description|
|-----|------|------|
|key	|required	|The key (name) of the cookie|
|value	|""	|The value of the cookie|
|max_age|	None|	Number of seconds or None (default)|
|expires	|None	|The date of then the cookie expires, must be a datetime object
|path|	None	|Limits the cookie to a given path|
|domain|	None|	specify a domain able to read the cookie (default is the domain that set it)|
|secure|	False	|If True, the cookie will only be available over HTTPS|
|httponly|	False	|Disallow JavaScript to access the cookie (Limited browser support)|
|samesite|	False	|Limits the scope of where the cookie is accessible to the same site|

These options give us a great deal of control of how our cookies work and provide plenty of ways to manage them.

Let's set the  `max_age`  and  `path`  keys with  `30`  seconds and the  `/cookies`  path:

`resp.set_cookie(
    "flavor", 
    value="chocolate chip",
    max_age=10,
    path=request.path
)` 

We've used  `request.path`  to access the path of the current route

If you check your browsers developer tools console, you'll see our  `flavor`  cookie now has an  `Expires on`  date along with a value for  `Path`  of  `/cookies`.

We're going to come back to  `max_age`  in a minute with another example, but now let's talk through how to access cookies.

### Accessing cookies

Just like we've used the  `request`  object to access many different request values including  `request.form`,  `request.args`,  `request.files`  and  `request.get_json()`..

We use  `request.cookies`  to access the cookies with the following syntax:
```py
cookies = request.cookies
```

If you run  `print(request.cookies)`  you'll see we get a nicely serialized Python disctionary:
```py
print(request.cookies)
```
```py
{'flavor': 'chocolate chip'}
```

As we're now working with a dictionary, we can access the individual values by key:
```py
flavor = cookies.get("flavor")
```

> Tip - Use  `cookies.get("key")`  to access keys in order to mute any key errors when trying to access the dictionary values by key

Let's set a few more cookies:
```py
resp.set_cookie("chocolate type", "dark")
resp.set_cookie("chewy", "yes")
```
If we now print  `request.cookies`, we see:

`{'flavor': 'chocolate chip', 'chocolate type': 'dark', 'chewy': 'yes'}` 

### max age

You may notice that even after setting  `max_age`  in our  `flavor`  cookie, it still hangs around in the developer tools.

Go ahead and comment out the first cookie we set:

`@app.route("/cookies")
def cookies():

    resp = make_response("Set cookies")

    cookies = request.cookies

    print(cookies)

    # resp.set_cookie(
    #     "flavor", 
    #     value="chocolate chip",
    #     max_age=10,
    #     path=request.path
    # )

    resp.set_cookie("chocolate type", "dark")
    resp.set_cookie("chewy", "yes")

    return resp` 

Refresh the page and give it 10 seconds or so. You'll notice we get the following in the terminal output:

`{'chocolate type': 'dark', 'chewy': 'yes'}` 

Even though the  `flavor`  cookie persists in the browser, it's not send to the server as we explicitly set the  `max_age`  variable in the cookie to 10 seconds. It will be deleted when the browser is closed.

> Tip - To delete cookies from your browser, right click on the domain in the  `cookies`  tab in the developer tools and click on  `delete`

### Setting cookies from the client

Setting cookies using JavaScript is also very simple.

`document.cookie = "key=value";` 

This will set the most basic type of cookie with no other meta information.

We can also provide the cookie with some more parameters like so:

`document.cookie = "key=value; expires=DDD, DD MMM YYYY HH:MM:SS UTC";` 

You can also add a path with the following:

`document.cookie = "key=value; expires=DDD, DD MMM YYYY HH:MM:SS UTC; path=/path";` 

You'll then be able to access any of the cookies set client-side using  `request.cookies`

### Sessions

Sessions use a special type of signed cookie, but you'll have to read the next episode in this series to learn more!
