# The Flask session object | Learning Flask Ep. 16

Using, understanding and decoding the Flask session object, the globally available signed & encoded cookie

Sessions in Flask are a way to store information about a specific user from one request to the next. They work by storing a cryptographically signed cookie on the users browser and decoding it on every request.

The sesison object can be treated just like a dictionary that persists across requests, making it an ideal place to store non sensitive user data.

**Important**

> The session object is NOT a secure way to store data. It's a base64 encoded string and can easily be decoded, thus not making it a secure way to save or access sensitive information.

We'll demonstrate decoding a session cookie shortly.

In this example, we're going to create a very unsecure system to allow users to log in and view their profile.

The purpose is to demonstrate the session object, not a secure user management system! This guide doesn't include any password hashing, user feedback or even a real database, it's purely for the demonstration of working with sessions.

### Login page

Let's start by creating a template allowing our user to login by providing a username and password:
```py
{% extends "public/templates/public_template.html" %}

{% block title %}sign up{% endblock %}

{% block main %}

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">

      <h1>Sign in</h1>
      <hr>

      <form action="/sign-in" method="POST">

        <div class="form-group">
          <label>Username</label>
          <input class="form-control" type="text" name="username">
        </div>

        <div class="form-group">
          <label>Password</label>
          <input class="form-control" type="password" name="password">
        </div>

        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Sign in</button>

      </form>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

{% endblock %}
```

### Flask imports

We need to import a few things from Flask for this example:

`from flask import render_template, request, session, redirect, url_for` 

-   `render_template`  - Allows us to render a template to the browser
-   `request`  - To handle the incoming form data and URL
-   `session`  - The session object
-   `redirect`  - Allows us to redirect users to various parts of our app
-   `url_for`  - Constructs URL's from arguments

### Mock database

We'll also need a mock database containing a couple of users (Feel free to change the values to something more familiar!):
```py
users = {
    "julian": {
        "username": "julian",
        "email": "julian@gmail.com",
        "password": "example",
        "bio": "Some guy from the internet"
    },
    "clarissa": {
        "username": "clarissa",
        "email": "clarissa@icloud.com",
        "password": "sweetpotato22",
        "bio": "Sweet potato is life"
    }
}
```

We're just using a dictionary containing 2 dictionaries to represent our users database.

### Secret Key

The session object requires your app to have a value set for the  `SECRET_KEY`  variable. You can either set it in your application config file or provide it somewhere in the file containing your views.

Whatever decision you make, it's best to declare it as soon as you assign the  `app`  variable.

The secret key is used to encode the session cookie, so it's advised to use something relitively complex.

A good place to generate a secret key is with  `secrets.token_urlsafe()`  and pass it an integer:
```py
import secrets
secrets.token_urlsafe(16)
```
```py
OCML3BRawWEUeaxcuKHLpw
```
Go ahead and create the  `SECRET_KEY`:
```py
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = "OCML3BRawWEUeaxcuKHLpw"
```
Now that we've got our imports, database and secret key, let's go ahead and build our routes.

### Sign in route

We need a route to handle signing our users in and setting up the session object:
```py
@app.route("/sign-in", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def sign_in():

    if request.method == "POST":

        req = request.form

        username = req.get("username")
        password = req.get("password")

        if not username in users:
            print("Username not found")
            return redirect(request.url)
        else:
            user = users[username]

        if not password == user["password"]:
            print("Incorrect password")
            return redirect(request.url)
        else:
            session["USERNAME"] = user["username"]
            print("session username set")
            return redirect(url_for("profile"))

    return render_template("public/sign_in.html")
```
As you can see, it's a relitively simple route, just for demostration.

-   We check if the username is in the database with  `if not username in users:`
-   If the user exists, we assign the user to  `user`  with  `user = users[username]`
-   We check the users password matches the password for the user in the database with  `if not password == user["password"]:`
-   If either checks fail, we redirect back to the URL of the request using  `redirect(request.url)`

If both checks pass, we assign the users username to the session key  `USERNAME`.

We can treat the session object just like a Python dictionary.

### Updating the session

To set a key & value:
```py
session["KEY"] = "VALUE"
```
In this case, we've assigned the session  `USERNAME`  key to the users username:
```py
session["USERNAME"] = user["username"]
```
If you were to  `print(session)`  just after we set the  `USERNAME`  key, you would see (Assuming the username of "julian"):
```py
<SecureCookieSession {'USERNAME': 'julian'}>
```

You'll also notice the redirect to  `profile`, using:
```py
return redirect(url_for("profile"))
```

Redirect takes a URL and redirects the client to it. In this case we've passed it  `url_for("profile")`.

`url_for`  takes arguments and builds an endpoint, in this case we've just passed the name of a function,  `"profile"`, to which it builds a URL.

We havent's created the profile route yet so let's go ahead and do so:

### Getting the session object
```py
@app.route("/profile")
def profile():

    if not session.get("USERNAME") is None:
        username = session.get("USERNAME")
        user = users[username]
        return render_template("public/profile.html", user=user)
    else:
        print("No username found in session")
        return redirect(url_for("sign_in"))
```
The session object is global, meaning we can access it from any part of our application and treat it like a dictionary.

In the  `profile`  route, we do the following:

`if not session.get("USERNAME") is None:` 

-   We use  `session.get("KEY")`  to check if the key exists in the session.
-   If the key doesn't exist,  `session.get("KEY")`  returns  `None`

`user = users[session.get("USERNAME")]` 

-   `username = session.get("USERNAME")`  assigns the  `username`  variable to the value saved in the session  `USERNAME`  key
-   We then assign the user from the  `users`  dictionary with  `user = users[username]`

`return render_template("public/profile.html", user=user)` 

-   If the user is found in the session, we call  `render_template`  and pass it the  `profile.html`  file, along with the  `user`

`else:
    print("No username found in session")
    return redirect(url_for("sign_in"))` 

-   If the  `USERNAME`  key is not in the session, we redirect back to the sign in page

Now we need to create the profile page!

### Profile page

Create a new file called  `profile.html`  and add the following:
```py
{% extends "public/templates/public_template.html" %}

{% block title %}Profile{% endblock %}

{% block main %}

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">

      <h1>Profile</h1>
      <hr>

      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h4>{{ user["username"] }}</h4>
          <hr>

          <p>{{ user["email"] }}</p>
          <p class="text-muted">{{ user["bio"] }}</p>

        </div>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

{% endblock %}` 

It's a very simple page containing some of the users details pulled from the database.

Before we go ahead and test any of our code, let's create a route to allow our user to logout.

### Popping sessions

We need to create a route that clears the  `USERNAME`  from the session object.

As  `session`  is just a Python object, we can pop a key from it!

Let's create a simple sign out route:

`@app.route("/sign-out")
def sign_out():

    session.pop("USERNAME", None)

    return redirect(url_for("sign_in"))` 

To pop a key from the session object:

`session.pop("KEY", None)` 

If a user who's been signed in visits this route, their  `USERNAME`  variable will be removed from the session and they'll be redirected to the sign in page.

We pass  `None`  to  `session.pop`  to make sure if a user who isn't signed in visits the sign out route, they will also be redirected to the sign in route without the application throwing an error.

Without  `None`, the application throws a  `KeyError`.

Let's test our app!

### Testing it out

Before you sign in, open up the developer tools in your browser and head over to the session storage.

For Chrome users:

-   Open the developer tools with  `Ctrl + Shift + i`
-   Select the  `Application`  tab along the top of the toolbar
-   Select  `Cookies`  from the sidebar on the left

For Firefox users:

-   Open the developer tools with  `Ctrl + Shift + i`
-   Select the  `Storage`  tab along the top of the toolbar
-   Select  `Cookies`  from the sidebar on the left

Go to  `/sign-in`, enter one of the usernames and passwords in the database and submit the form.

You should see a cookie appear with the name  `session`  and an encoded string in the value entry.

![Flask session cookie](https://pythonise.com/static/img/uploads/flask-session-devtools.PNG "Flask session cookie")

If all went as it should, you'll be at the profile page for the user and see some of their details.

Now go to  `/sign-out`  in the browser and you should be redirected to the sign in page. The session cookie should also be removed and you'll no longer see it in the developer tools.

### Session best practices

As mentioned before, the session object is NOT a secure place to store data as it can be easily decoded.

Some examples of what you'd store in the session object:

-   Unique user ID's
-   Publicly visible usernames
-   Tracking ID's
-   User preferences

Ideally, you'd store as much as you can in a database or local cache, such as Redis.

NEVER put passwords or ANY sensitive information in the session object! As we'll now demonstrate why...

### Decoding the session

Log back into the application and open up the developer tools.

In the developer tools, head to the  `Network`  tab and look for the  `POST`  request to the  `/sign-in`  route. Click on it.

Under  `Response headers`, you'll see  `Set-Cookie:`  with a value similar to the following:

`session=eyJVU0VSTkFNRSI6Imp1bGlhbiJ9.XGxnkw.0-dtOEX9rJYS9MqYgnM9reWr7dY; HttpOnly; Path=/` 

Copy this string and start an instance of the Python interpreter in your terminal or console.

`python` 

Import base64:

`>>> import base64` 

We're going to pass the session tookie to  `base64.b64decode()`  which requires the string to not be 1 more than a multiple of 4 in character length.

You may have to delete a character or 2 from the string until you get the right number of characters.

Decode the string using  `base64.b64decode("session_cookie")`:

`>>> base64.b64decode("eyJVU0VSTkFNRSI6Imp1bGlhbiJ9.XGxnkw.0-dtOEX9rJYS9MqYgnM9reWr7dY; HttpOnly; Path=")` 

After stripping  `session=`  and the trailing  `/`  from the string, we got the following output:

`b'{"USERNAME":"julian"}\\lg\x93\r\x1d\xb4\xe1\x17\xf6\xb2XK\xd3*b\t\xcc\xf6\xb7\x96\xaf\xb7X\x1e\xdbi:yr=\xaba'` 

As you can clearly see, we've decoded the string and revealed the  `USERNAME`  value. The rest is just padding.

I hope this illustrated why you should never store anything sensitive in the session!

### Wrapping up

The session object in Flask is an extremely useful tool for remembering and sharing state across an application and should be used with care.

It can be accessed globally across your application and in templates using the Jinja  `{{ session["KEY"] }}`  syntax.

Just remember to set a secret key and keep it safe. Ideally in an app config file and out of version control!

**views.py**

`from flask import render_template, request, session, redirect, url_for

app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = "OCML3BRawWEUeaxcuKHLpw"

users = {
    "julian": {
        "username": "julian",
        "email": "julian@gmail.com",
        "password": "example",
        "bio": "Some guy from the internet"
    },
    "clarissa": {
        "username": "clarissa",
        "email": "clarissa@icloud.com",
        "password": "sweetpotato22",
        "bio": "Sweet potato is life"
    }
}

@app.route("/sign-in", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def sign_in():

    if request.method == "POST":

        req = request.form

        username = req.get("username")
        password = req.get("password")

        if not username in users:
            print("Username not found")
            return redirect(request.url)
        else:
            user = users[username]

        if not password == user["password"]:
            print("Incorrect password")
            return redirect(request.url)

        else:
            session["USERNAME"] = user["username"]
            print(session)
            print("session username set")
            return redirect(url_for("profile"))

    return render_template("public/sign_in.html")

@app.route("/profile")
def profile():

    if not session.get("USERNAME") is None:
        username = session.get("USERNAME")
        user = users[username]
        return render_template("public/profile.html", user=user)
    else:
        print("No username found in session")
        return redirect(url_for("sign_in"))

@app.route("/sign-out")
def sign_out():

    session.pop("USERNAME", None)

    return redirect(url_for("sign_in"))`
