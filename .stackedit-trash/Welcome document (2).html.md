> **Tip:** Make sure you include **MathJax** into your publications to render mathematical expression properly. Your page/template should include something like this:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://stackedit.io/libs/MathJax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>
```

> **Note:** You can find more information about **LaTeX** mathematical expressions [here](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).

### UML diagrams

You can also render sequence diagrams like this:

And flow charts like this:
