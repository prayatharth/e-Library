### [The Joy of JavaScript](https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-javascript?utm_source=freecontentcenter&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=book_thejoyofjavascript&utm_content=slideshare_01)
Whether for building interactive browser-based applications or creating server-side applications in Node, JavaScript is the most widely used language for web programming. With new features, language improvements, paradigms, and potential use cases appearing regularly, there’s never been a more exciting time to be a JavaScript developer. In The Joy of JavaScript, author and JavaScript expert Luis Atencio teaches you key design concepts that lead to clean, lean, modular, and easy-to-maintain code.
