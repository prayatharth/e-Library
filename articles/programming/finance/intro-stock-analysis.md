## Introduction to the Financial Time Series Analysis using Pandas

* [http://www.quantsbin.com/introduction-stock-analysis-pandas1/](http://www.quantsbin.com/introduction-stock-analysis-pandas1/)

As defined in Investopedia A time series is a sequence of numerical data points in successive order. Generally, observation points are successively equally spaced in time. Most of the financial data is in the time series format and hence "Financial Time Series Analysis" is an important tool for anyone trying to understand the historical movements, predict the future movements or manage the risk associated with the future movements.

2. Ploting Time Series data The first step to understand and analyse financial data is through visualization. By simply ploting the financial timeseries we can get the understanding of how an investment has performed over the time period.

Plot the Stock Price data The code given below uses the package matplotlib.pyplot to plot the 'Close', 'High' and 'Low' columns of the time series downloaded for NIFTY50 as a line graph. We can customize the chart to show its title, the label for the y axis and its legend.

plt.rcParams\['figure.figsize'\] = \[12, 8\] \_ = nifty\_levels\_test\[\['Close','High','Low'\]\].plot\(\) plt.ylabel\('Index Level'\) plt.title \(ticker +' LEVEL TIME SERIES'\) plt.legend\(\) plt.show\(\)

Plot Subplot for Price and Volume traded The code given below subsets the timeseries downloaded for NIFTY50 for dates greater than 2017-12-31 and handles the missing values by using the forward fill method. Then it creates 2 subplots, one of which is the line chart for 'Close', 'High' and 'Low', while the second is the line chart for the volume of 'Shares Traded'. Looking at these graphs adjacent to each other helps us in observing the relationship between price movement and volumen traded.

slice_start\_date = pd.datetime\(2017,12,31\) nifty\_levels\_test\_sliced = nifty\_levels\_test\[nifty\_levels\_test.index &gt; slice\_start\_date\].fillna\(method='ffill'\) f, \(a0, a1\) = plt.subplots\(2,1, gridspec\_kw = {'height\_ratios':\[3, 1\]}\)_  = nifty\_levels\_test\_sliced\[\['Close','High','Low'\]\].plot\(ax=a0\) a0.set\_ylabel\('Index Level'\) a0.grid\(True\) a0.set\_xticklabels\(\[\]\) x\_label = a0.set\_xlabel\(''\) x\_label.set\_visible\(False\) a0.set\_title \(ticker +' LEVEL TIME SERIES \(Sliced\)'\) a0.legend\(\) nifty\_levels\_test\_sliced\['Shares Traded'\].plot\(ax=a1\) a1.set\_ylabel\('Volume'\) f.tight\_layout\(\) plt.show\(\)

Normalize the Time Series A financial time series is normalized to observe how an investment of x amount changes with time. It is useful for comparing the performance of multiple time series.

Normalization is done by using the formula given below:

p\(t\)p\(0\)âˆ—xfor 0&lt;=t&lt;=T where T is period end date

The code given below normalizes and plots the sliced time series to see how an investment of 1000 made in NIFTY50 on 2017-12-31 changes over time.

nifty_close\_levels = nifty\_levels\_test\_sliced\['Close'\] normalised\_start\_level = 1000 nifty\_close\_normalized = nifty\_close\_levels/nifty\_close\_levels\[0\]\*normalised\_start\_level_  = nifty\_close\_normalized.plot\(\) plt.ylabel\('Index Level'\) plt.title \(ticker +' LEVEL TIME SERIES \(Normalized\)'\) plt.legend\(\) plt.show\(\)

We will try to repeat the above process but this time with multiple stocks

stock\_codes = stock\_codes =\["GM", "F", "AAPL", "MSFT"\] start\_date\_multi = '2011-12-31' source = 'WIKI/PRICES' stock\_prices = qd.get\_table\(source, qopts = { 'columns': \['ticker', 'date', 'adj\_close'\] }, ticker = stock\_codes, date = { 'gte': start\_date\_multi, 'lte': end\_date }\) print\(stock\_prices.head\(\)\) ticker date adj\_close None  
0 MSFT 2018-03-27 89.47 1 MSFT 2018-03-26 93.78 2 MSFT 2018-03-23 87.18 3 MSFT 2018-03-22 89.79 4 MSFT 2018-03-21 92.48 We need to process above dataframe further to get desired format

stock\_prices\_formatted = stock\_prices.pivot\(columns = 'ticker', index='date', values='adj\_close'\) stock\_prices\_formatted.head\(\) ticker AAPL F GM MSFT date  
2012-01-03 52.848787 8.772734 18.035831 22.792249 2012-01-04 53.132802 8.906729 18.121512 23.332995 2012-01-05 53.722681 9.135309 18.995457 23.571435 2012-01-06 54.284287 9.229893 19.638064 23.933352 2012-01-09 54.198183 9.300832 19.569519 23.622529 This time we will try Plotly to plot interactive plots.

data = \[go.Scatter\(x=stock\_prices\_formatted.index, y=stock\_prices\_formatted\[udl\_code\], name=udl\_code\) for udl\_code in stock\_prices\_formatted.columns\] layout = dict\( title = "Price Time Series"\)

fig = dict\(data=data, layout=layout\) py.iplot\(fig, filename = 'Price Time Series'\)

Its difficult to compare the performane of different underlying give they all are trading at different levels. Normalisation as discussed above will help to compare performance of these 4 stocks.

norm\_stock\_prices\_formatted = stock\_prices\_formatted/stock\_prices\_formatted.iloc\[0,:\]\*100 data = \[go.Scatter\(x=norm\_stock\_prices\_formatted.index, y=norm\_stock\_prices\_formatted\[udl\_code\], name=udl\_code\) for udl\_code in norm\_stock\_prices\_formatted.columns\] layout = dict\( title = "Normalized Price Time Series"\)

fig = dict\(data=data, layout=layout\) py.iplot\(fig, filename = 'Normalized Price Time Series'\)

1. Returns Calculation

   The return of a financial instrument is the profit/loss incurred on an investment over a period of time, expressed as a proportion of the original investment. It gives a complete, scale-free summary of the investment opportunity.

The simple single period return of financial instrument is calculated using the formula given below

R\(t\)=P\(f\)P\(i\)âˆ’1where P\(i\) and P\(f\) are the prices at the starting time point and ending time point of the period The code given below calculates the simple return for the period between 2017-12-31 and 2018-06-30

nifty\_simple\_return = \(nifty\_close\_levels\[-1\]/nifty\_close\_levels\[0\] -1\) print\("Nifty returns for period starting from {} till {} is {:.2f}%".format \(slice\_start\_date.date\(\),end\_date, nifty\_simple\_return\*100\)\) Nifty returns for period starting from 2017-12-31 till 2018-06-30 is 2.67% Simple Daily Return The daily return is the day over day return.

The underlying formula for calculating simple daily return is

R\(t\)=\(P\(t\)P\(tâˆ’1\)âˆ’1\)for 0&lt;=t&lt;=T

The code given below calculates the daily returns using the pandas dataframe function pct\_change. We also calculated the mean daily simple return, which comes out to be close to zero. This tells the importance of compounding effect.

The return series hence obtained is first plotted as a line chart and then as a histogram to observe its underlying distribution. From histogram we can observe that return distribution is bell shaped and similar to famous normal distribution.

daily_returns = nifty\_levels\_test\['Close'\].pct\_change\(\) print\("Avg daily return is {:.6f}%".format\(daily\_returns.mean\(\)\*100\)\)_  = daily\_returns.plot\(\) plt.ylabel\('Index Daily Returns'\) plt.title \(ticker +' RETURN TIME SERIES'\) plt.legend\(\) plt.rcParams\['figure.figsize'\] = \[12, 8\] plt.show\(\) \_1 = daily\_returns.hist\(bins=30\) plt.title\('Daily return distribution'\) plt.show\(\) Avg daily return is 0.038790%

Logarithmic Return / Continuously Compounded Return The logarithmic return or continuously compounded return, D\(t\), is calculated using the formula

D\(t\)=log\(P\(f\)P\(i\)\)where P\(i\) and P\(f\) are the initial and the final prices of the instrumentD\(t\)=log\(R\(t\)+1\)where R\(t\) is the simple return during the period The advantages of using log returns over simple returns are as follows:

The logarithmic returns are symmetric in nature, as opposed to simple returns. In case the prices are distributed log-normally, log\(1+R\(t\)\) is distributed normally. The log returns are additive in nature. The code given below calculates the log returns using the log function from the numpy library. Instead of calculating log returns from scratch, we have used simple returns timeseries to calculate log returns.

The returns hence obtained are plotted as a histogram to observe the distribution of these returns. As we can observe the log returns distribution is also bell shaped and similar to normal distibution.

daily\_log\_returns = np.log\(daily\_returns+1\) \_1 = daily\_log\_returns.hist\(bins=30\) plt.title\('Daily log return distribution'\) plt.show\(\)

Compound Annual Growth Rate \(CAGR\) The Compound Annual Growth Rate \(CAGR\) is the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time longer than one year. It describes the rate at which an investment would have grown, if it had grown at a steady rate, which doesn't ususally happen in reality. CAGR can be essentially viewed as a way to smooth out an investmentâ€™s returns so that they may be more easily understood.

The formula for calculating CAGR is

R\(t\)=\(P\(f\)P\(i\)\)\(1n\)âˆ’1where P\(f\) and P\(i\) are the final and the initial values for a period and n is the time in years CAGR is a relatively simple metric and hence has a variety of uses.

CAGR can be used to calculate the average growth of a single investment It can be used to compare investments of different types with one another. For example it can be used to compare an investment in risk free instrument with an investment in a portfolio with varying growth rate It can also be used to track the performance of various business measures of one or multiple companies alongside one another The code given below illustrates how CAGR can be calculated.

time\_in\_years = \(nifty\_levels\_test.index\[-1\] - nifty\_levels\_test.index\[0\]\).days/365.0 cagr = \(nifty\_levels\_test\['Close'\]\[-1\]/nifty\_levels\_test\['Close'\]\[0\]\)_\*\(1/time\_in\_years\) - 1 print\("Compound annual growth rate from {} to {} for {} is {:.2f}%".format \(nifty\_levels\_test.index\[0\].date\(\), nifty\_levels\_test.index\[-1\].date\(\), ticker, cagr_100\)\) Compound annual growth rate from 2010-01-04 to 2018-06-29 for NSE/NIFTY\_50 is 8.81% 4. Volatility Calculation Annualized Volatility Annualised volatility is the degree of variation observed in the prices of a financial instrument over a period of one year. It can be calculated by scaling the daily volatility, which is measured as the standard deviation of the returns of the stock prices, to 1 year. The daily volatility can be scaled to annual by simply multiplying with 252âˆ’âˆ’âˆ’âˆš \(considering that there are 252 business days in a year\) in case it is calculated as the standard deviation of the log returns.

The code given below calcluates annualised volatility by calculating the standard deviation of log returns of NIFTY50 using pandas dataframe function std and then multiplying it by 252âˆ’âˆ’âˆ’âˆš .

volatility = daily\_log\_returns.std\(\)  _\(252\*\*0.5\) print\("Annualized daily volatility from {} to {} for {} is {:.2f}%".format \(nifty\_levels\_test.index\[0\].date\(\), nifty\_levels\_test.index\[-1\].date\(\), ticker, volatility_100\)\) Annualized daily volatility from 2010-01-04 to 2018-06-29 for NSE/NIFTY\_50 is 15.58% N-days Rolling Volatility N-days rolling volatility is calculated by rolling the dates for a window of N days and using the corresponding data for calculating the volatility.

The code given below calculates the rolling annualized volatility for NIFTY50 for a window of 252 days using pandas function rolling. The series of rolling volatility hence obtained is plotted on the secondary y-axis, along with index levels plotted on the primary y-axis.

rolling\_volatility = daily\_log\_returns.rolling\(window = 252\).std\(\)_\(252\*\*0.5\)_100 nifty\_levels\_test\['Close'\].plot\(label='Index Levels', color='Blue'\) plt.ylabel\(ticker + ' levels'\) plt.legend\(\) ax = plt.gca\(\) ax2 = ax.twinx\(\) ax2.set\_ylim\(ymax=50\) rolling\_volatility.plot\(label='Volatility'\) plt.title\(ticker +" levels and 252 days Rolling Volatility"\) plt.ylabel\("Volatility in %"\) plt.legend\(\) plt.show\(\)

Return Distribution Analysis Through below excercises we are comparing NIFTY50 log returns ditribution with Normal distribution using various methods.

Many simple models assume underlying distribution to be normal and hence it is very important for us to understand the distribution of our data to develop an understanding about the challenges posed when the data is run on models having Normality as an assumption.

Read more about Normal distribution here

Quantile-Quantile Plot \(Q-Q Plot\) The quantile-quantile \(q-q\) plot is a graphical technique for determining if two data sets come from populations with a common distribution, such as Normal, Exponential,etc. It is created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another. If both sets of quantiles came from the same distribution, we should see the points forming a line thatâ€™s roughly straight. Normal q-q plot is used more frequently in practice due to so many statistical methods assuming normality. For creating the plot, the quantile of our sample data is plotted against the quantile calculated from a theoretical distribution. A 45-degree reference line is also plotted to see the alignment.

The normal q-q plot for sample data belonging to a skewed distribution will from a curve instead of a straight line. On the other hand, the normal q-q plot for a distribution with heavy tails will have points fall along a line in the middle of the graph, but curved off in the extremities.

The code given below calculates the z-score for the daily log returns and then plots its quantile against that of a theoretical normal distribution to generate the Normal Q-Q Plot.

z = \(daily\_log\_returns\[1:\]-np.mean\(daily\_log\_returns\[1:\]\)\)/np.std\(daily\_log\_returns\[1:\]\) stats.probplot\(z, dist="norm", plot=plt\) plt.title\("Normal Q-Q plot"\) plt.rcParams\['figure.figsize'\] = \[12, 8\] plt.show\(\)

The above Normal Q-Q plot indicates that the distribution of the log returns is heavy tailed.

Kurtosis and Skewness Kurtosis â€” Kurtosis is a measure of the combined weight of a distribution's tails relative to the center of the distribution. It esssentially tells us whether the data is heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. The kurtosis of any univariate normal distribution is 3. Distributions with kurtosis less than 3 are said to be platykurtic, while those with kurtosis greater than 3 are said to be leptokurtic. In python, the kurtosis can be calculated using the kurtosis function of pandas. This, however, calculates the excess Kurtosis\(Kurtosis expressed as above or below 3\), as it assumes the Fisher's definition of Kurtosis, whereby Kurtosis of Normal distribution is equal to 0.

Skewness â€” Skewness is a measure of symmetricity of the distribution and can be mathematically defined as the averaged cubed deviation from the mean divided by the standard deviation cubed. If the result of the computation is greater than zero, the distribution is positively skewed. If it's less than zero, it's negatively skewed. If equal to zero, it's roughly symmetric. Normal distrbution has a skewness measure of zero. The funtion skew of pandas can be used to calculate the skewness of a distribution.

daily\_return\_excess\_kurtosis = daily\_log\_returns\[1:\].kurtosis\(\) daily\_return\_excess\_skewness = daily\_log\_returns\[1:\].skew\(\) print\("Excess Kurtosis of distribution of {} daily returns is {:.3f}".format\(ticker, daily\_return\_excess\_kurtosis\)\) print\("Skewness of distribution of {} daily returns is {:.3f}".format\(ticker, daily\_return\_excess\_skewness\)\)

## p = stats.normaltest\(daily\_returns\[1:\]\)\[1\]

## p1 = adfuller\(daily\_returns\[1:\]\)\[1\]

## print\(p1\)

## print\(p\)

Excess Kurtosis of distribution of NSE/NIFTY\_50 daily returns is 1.756 Skewness of distribution of NSE/NIFTY\_50 daily returns is -0.195 JB Test for Normality The Jarque-Bera Test \(JB Test\) is a test for Normality. Specifically, the test matches the skewness and kurtosis of data to see if it matches a Normal distribution.

The JB test tests the hypothesis

Ho : Data is Normal

Ha : Data is NOT Normal

using the test statistic

JBTestStat=n\(Skewness^26+ExcessKurtosis^224\)where n is the sample size If data came from a Normal distriubtion, the test statistic would assume the value zero.

Note that this test only works for a large enough number of data samples \(&gt;2000\) as the test statistic asymptotically has a Chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.

The code given below calculates the JB test statistic and its corresponding p-value for the distribution using the function jarque\_bera from scipy.stats

JB\_TestStat = len\(daily\_log\_returns\[1:\]\)_\(\(daily\_return\_excess\_skewness\*2\)/6+\(daily\_return\_excess\_kurtosis_2\)/24\) print\("JB test statistic calculated for {} daily returns is {:.3f}".format\(ticker,JB\_TestStat\)\)

JB\_TestStat,JBpv = stats.jarque\_bera\(daily\_log\_returns\[1:\]\) print\("JB test statistic for {} daily returns is {:.3f}".format\(ticker,JB\_TestStat\)\) print\("p-value for JB test for {} daily returns is {:.3f}".format\(ticker,JBpv\)\)

if JBpv&gt;0.05: print\("The p-value of {} implies that we reject the alternate hypothesis of distribution of log returns of {} not being normal with 95% confidence level".format\(JBpv,ticker\)\) else: print\("The p-value of {} implies that we reject the null hypothesis of distribution of log returns of {} being normal with 95% confidence level".format\(JBpv,ticker\)\)

JB test statistic calculated for NSE/NIFTY\_50 daily returns is 284.384 JB test statistic for NSE/NIFTY\_50 daily returns is 282.208 p-value for JB test for NSE/NIFTY\_50 daily returns is 0.000 The p-value of 0.0 implies that we reject the null hypothesis of distribution of log returns of NSE/NIFTY\_50 being normal with 95% confidence level 7. Heatmap and Seasonality Monthly Returns as a Heatmap A heatmap is a graphical representation of matrix data where the individual values contained are represented as colors.

The code given below plots the monthly returns against their respective years in the form of a heatmap. It is done by first resampling the daily data as monthly, by taking the last published value of the month. Using these end of month levels, we calculate the monthly return, which is then grouped by 'Year' and 'Month'. The matrix hence obtained is plotted as a heatmap using the function heatmap of the library seaborn.

The colour scheme of the map highlights the high positive returns towards the green side of the spectrum, while high negative returns are towards the red side.

Drawdown Analysis A drawdown is the peak-to-trough decline during a specific recorded period of an investment, fund or commodity security. It is usually quoted as the percentage between the peak and the subsequent trough and it respresents the downside risk. Drawdowns help determine an investment's financial risk by evaluating recovery-period, which is the time taken for the investment to recover from a decline in its net asset value back to the peak.

The code given below calculates the Maximum Rolling Drawdown for a window of 250 days, which is essentially the largest percentage loss a hypothetical investor could have incurred on the investment over a period of 250 days. It also calculates the recovery period and finally highlights the maximum drawdown period and recovery period, along with the plots for maximum rolling drawdown and index closing levels.
