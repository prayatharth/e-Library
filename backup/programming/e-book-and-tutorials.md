### The Quick Python Book, Third Edition

This third revision of Manning's popular _The Quick Python Book_ offers a clear, crisp updated introduction to the elegant Python programming language and its famously easy-to-read syntax. Written for programmers new to Python, this latest edition includes new exercises throughout. It covers features common to other languages concisely, while introducing Python's comprehensive standard functions library and unique features in detail. ![enter image description here](https://images.manning.com/720/960/resize/book/9/afe7a0c-3fd0-4676-92ea-62d7cf929064/Ceder-QPython-3ed-HI.png)

[Figure 2.3. Using the Python shell in IDLE. Code is automatically colored \(based on Python syntax\) as it’s typed in. Placing the cursor on any previous command and pressing the Enter key moves the command and the cursor to the bottom, where you can edit the command and then press Enter to send it to the interpreter. Placing the cursor at the bottom, you can toggle up and down through the history of previous commands by pressing Alt-P and Alt-N. When you have the command you want, edit it as desired and press Enter, and it will be sent to the interpreter.](https://livebook.manning.com/book/the-quick-python-book-third-edition/chapter-2/ch02fig03)

### Exploring Python Basics

This ebook will let you explore the basics of programming with one of the most popular languages in the world right now, Python. Python is popular in a number of areas—it powers the Django web framework, which makes it easy to create database powered web sites; it’s an all purpose work horse on the back end, gluing programs together and connecting data pipelines; with tools like pandas, numpy, and tensor-flow \(and many, many others\) it’s a star in data science; and combined with the tiny \(but mighty\) raspberry pi and other boards it puts the power of computing literally in the palm of your hand. ![enter image description here](https://images.manning.com/720/960/resize/book/6/ef20a70-faf1-410e-ac8e-403fdeeab7c1/Ceder_EPB_hires.png) **Chapters** Part 1.

### [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html)

If you know how to program with Python and also know a little about probability, you’re ready to tackle Bayesian statistics. With this book, you'll learn how to solve statistical problems with Python code instead of mathematical notation, and use discrete probability distributions instead of continuous mathematics. Once you get the math out of the way, the Bayesian fundamentals will become clearer, and you’ll begin to apply these techniques to real-world problems.

  For many researchers, Python is a first-class tool mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. Several resources exist for individual pieces of this data science stack, but only with the Python Data Science Handbook do you get them all— [**IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn**](e-book-and-tutorials.md) , and other related tools.

  \*\*\*\*[**Programming with Types !**](https://livebook.manning.com/book/programming-with-types/welcome/v-5/)\*\*\*\*

  I started writing this book in an attempt to bridge the gap between the more mathematical, academic treatments of type systems and the day-to-day practical applications of types. Types are important, and there’s a clear trend towards better type systems. Haskell is gaining in popularity, TypeScript was invented to provide static typing to JavaScript, Python introduced type hints into the language, Rust has its borrow checker, and so on.

  Whether for building interactive browser-based applications or creating server-side applications in Node, JavaScript is the most widely used language for web programming. With new features, language improvements, paradigms, and potential use cases appearing regularly, there’s never been a more exciting time to be a JavaScript developer. In The Joy of JavaScript, author and JavaScript expert Luis Atencio teaches you key design concepts that lead to clean, lean, modular, and easy-to-maintain code.
