**While mobile-first approach becomes a standard and uncertain network conditions are something we should always take into consideration it’s harder and harder to keep your application loading fast. In this series I’ll dig deep into Vue performance optimization techniques that we are using in** [**Vue Storefront**](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront) **and that you can use in your Vue.js applications to make them loading instantly and perform smooth. My goal is to make this series a full and complete guide on Vue apps performance.**
