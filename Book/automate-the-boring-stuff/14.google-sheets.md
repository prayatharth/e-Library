14 Working With Google Sheets
===
Google Sheets, the free, web-based spreadsheet application available to anyone with a Google account or Gmail address, has become a useful, feature-rich competitor to Excel. Google Sheets has its own API, but this API can be confusing to learn and use. This chapter covers the EZSheets third-party module, documented at  _[https://ezsheets.readthedocs.io/](https://ezsheets.readthedocs.io/)_. While not as full featured as the official Google Sheets API, EZSheets makes common spreadsheet tasks easy to perform.
